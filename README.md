## Guidelines for sharing scripts

- All code should include sufficient annotation and documentation so that other users can understand and run the scripts. 
- Write your scripts such that other users can run the code without modifications (except for changing file paths). Scripts that can only be run by users with a specific operating system or software should be clearly denoted.
- Include an attribution header to your scripts. It's easy to create a standard code snippet that you can add to all of your scripts, see these useful instructions at this blog post: https://timfarewell.co.uk/my-r-script-header-template/

Here is an example header code snippet:
##############################################################################################
#' @title Give your script a name that describes its purpose

#' @author
#' Lee Stanish \email{lstanish@battelleecology.org} \cr

#' @description Add description. Ex. Post-processing script to look more closely at data differences for soil moisture

#' @return Describe what it returns. Ex. NEON Soil Physical Properties downloaded as .csv file and pdf plots of soil edaphic data by site

# changelog and author contributions / copyrights
#   Lee Stanish (20XX-MM-DD)
#     original creation
