However, this purity is not sufficient and Type I water (18.2 Mohm) has been used for all bouts conducted from 2018 onward. 2017 data was thus collected using a deprecated method and has been flagged accordingly. Moreover, 2 sites extracted in 2017 (JORN AND MOAB) had extremely high ammonium concentrations in both samples and blanks (> 1 mg/L) due to this use of less purified water. These data were deemed unusable, thus values were removed and the records have an additional flag.","Type I water (18.2 Mohm) has been used for all nitrogen transformation bouts conducted from 2018 onward, and 2017 records have been flagged."

Extensive troubleshooting has revealed that certain batches of potassium chloride (KCl) used by NEON for extractions have high levels of nitrite, which is chemodenitrified (abiotically converted to nitrogen gas and lost) in the presence of acidic soil, but not in blanks (Homyak et al. 2015). This artifact is what causes the significant negative values and greatly reduces sensitivity of the method for low-concentration sites. NEON has tried to solve this issue but has not yet been able to find a reliable solution.","Either find a reliable source of nitrite-free KCl to use for extractions, or spin up a method to purify the KCl ourselves. This is an ongoing issue that will be updated when more details are available. Any samples with concentration values that blank-correct to < -0.02 mgN/L are flagged with 'blanks exceed sample value' in the nitrateNitriteNQF field, and end users can decide how to treat these data."

If field collection of soil from a specific subplot within an assigned soil plot was not possible, samplingImpractical is populated with a value other than 'OK' (e.g., 'location flooded' or 'logistical') and only minimal metadata are recorded."

While all NEON soil samples are dried at 65C in the domain labs, they are often then stored for weeks to months before being shipped to or analyzed by external labs. During this time they may accumulate moisture, especially in humid areas. Subsequent testing revealed that for organic horizons, %C data are likely underestimated by 1.5-2.5% due to this lack of re-drying prior to analysis. As organic horizon soil samples tend to have high %C (> 20%), this bias may have only minor impacts on many analyses, but is something for end users to keep in mind. For the other parameters (%N, C:N, d15N, d13C) as well as all parameters in mineral horizons, testing suggests there were no detectable differences between re-dried samples and originals.","Affected O-horizon data have been flagged with dataQF = dryingProtocolError in the `sls_soilChemistry` table. For sample analysis dates starting in November 2020, all carbon-nitrogen samples (both mineral and organic horizons) are re-dried at 65C prior to analysis to drive out any residual moisture and improve data accuracy for % C. Samples collected in 2020 may have been analyzed before or after the change; check dataQF to determine which individual samples are affected."

Specifically, sampleIDs included the distance east and north of the southwest corner of a plot (in meters). However, including high resolution spatial information in sampleIDs proved problematic when the location was mis-transcribed in the field. Such errors are difficult to detect and very time-consuming to correct.","To improve data accuracy and data QAQC efficiency, the precise sampling locations are no longer included in the sampleID, and the subplot number is used instead (a choice of 21, 23, 39, and 41). The remainder of the sampleID is unchanged, including the plot, soil horizon, and collect date components.
